Frame Index
FrameNet Index of Lexical Units

This page is an index to alphabetical lists of the names of the lexical units (LUs).

Each LU name is followed by the part of speech, the name of the relevant frame, and its status. If a lexical unit has the status "Finished_initial" (meaning it was annotated in FN2) or "FN1_sent" (meaning annotated in FN1), it will be followed by links to the HTML files for the lexical entry and the annotated sentences. Lexical units on which work has not been completed may have only a link for the lexical entry, or no link at all. The lexical entry provdes two tables with information about the LU:Frame Elements and their Syntactic Realizations; and Valence Patterns.
